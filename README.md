# Speak-It
A user-to-user language learning / sharing web application

## Introduction: 

Speak-It is a video chat application for users who want to directly learn a language with a native speaker. Users login with their study language and native language. From the menu, a user can send an invitation to another user who natively speaks in the user's study language and wishes to learn the user's native language. Once the recipient accepts the invitation, both users are redirected to a webcam where they switch roles as the native speaker and the student. Speak-It seeks to simplify language learning and transform it into a more cultural and social experience.
