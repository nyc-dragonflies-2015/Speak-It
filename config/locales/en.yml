When you are the native speaker you are kindly asked not to provide instruction, but to simply carry a conversation. As a student, you are simply asked to try your best. You may use words from your native language if necessary, but will not get full credit if you do so. Native speakers are asked to judge the student's speaking skills based on pronunciation, vocabulary, and clarity."

    second_chat_description: "Alright, good job with the first conversation! Now your roles will switch. The student will become the native speaker, and the native speaker will become the student. Get ready for the next conversation topic, and best of luck!"

    final_instructions_description: "Great job everyone! Now that you've had the opportunity of practicing your language skills, make sure you thank each other for helping out in your effort to learn a new language. From here you can fill out the assessment on how your partner did. You can also suggest ways that they might improve their fluency. Make sure you make specific, actionable, and kind feedback. Take care!"
